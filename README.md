# Running On Empty


# Project Title
Running On Empty

## Description
Running-On-Empty can best be described as a scavenger hunt performed by a band of misfits looking to kill an afternoon and have a few drinks. A run starts at a single location (bar, garage, or local park) and a trail will be made with a batch of marks laid by the one (or two) individual(s). The marks on the ground will determine what happens at each point along the run. Runs are typically a distance from 2 to 4 miles (weather depending).All running events are determined by the event creator.  To create an event users will need to create an account throught this app. Feel free to spice things up such as making a theme for the run.
