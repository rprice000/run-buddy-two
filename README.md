## Running on Empty
# About
Running-On-Empty can best be described as a scavenger hunt performed by a band of misfits looking to kill an afternoon and have a few drinks. A run starts at a single location (bar, garage, or local park) and a trail will be made with a batch of marks laid by the one (or two) individual(s). The marks on the ground will determine what happens at each point along the run. Runs are typically a distance from 2 to 4 miles (weather depending). All running events are determined by the event creator. To create an event users will need to create an account throught this app. Feel free to spice things up such as making a theme for the run. 
# Functionality
On the website you can view events, delete events, add comments, update if you're attending the event as well as view your profile and others who have created events.
This simple platform makes it easy for users who want to join these type of events and check out others who are attending.
You can also interact with people on this platform who may also be attending the events.
